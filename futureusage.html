                            Welcome to the page on future possible robot usage, this will include robots that I am thinking of using in the future as well as robots I feel would be useful for farming in general. 
                            Some of these robots will already be in existence whereas others will be in a purely theoretical state at the moment.  I will try to explain each of them in full although explanations 
                            for the theoretical ones will not be as expansive as less information is known about them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first robot I will talk about is the one as shown to the right which is an automatic food dispenser.  This particular robot is incredibly useful for feeding animals at a regular 
                            interval in consistent amounts that can be programmed in, for a much healthier feeding of the animals.  This would be especially useful for times when you might be on holiday or for 
                            feeding throughout the night when you would be unable to feed them.  It would also allow you to do other tasks around the farm instead of having to spend time feeding the animals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second robot I will talk about is a milking machine for cows.  There are a few different variations of this machine but all of them can milk cows automatically, most of the time 
                            machines will get more milk out of a cow than a person milking could.  Some variations of this machine can be set up to milk the cows when they choose or when they are feeding.  This 
                            makes the process of milking much kinder on the cow as well as it having a choice in when it is milked rather than it always being the farmers choice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The third robot I will talk about is an automatic harvesting robot.  A basic version of this to harvest an entire wheat field for instance would be quite easy to implement as it would 
                            be very similar to the method for ploughing.  A much more complicated version could be made for tasks like picking ripened fruit, this would require a much more complicated program 
                            with a lot of sensory input and and an advanced AI to decide whether to pick a certain fruit.  This would be a massive task and expensive to set up but once it is working it should be 
                            much more efficient that having manual pickers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using robots for farming does have its downsides including upfront and maintaining costs as well as possible breakdowns/errors but if they are used correctly with enough knowledge 
                            they can be a very powerful tool to make farming have larger production and easier running.  The cost difference will vary depending on the circumstances but as wages go up using 
                            robotics will become more cost effective.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is an example usage where you could have a robot automatically dispense food for animals including cows, this could be done automatically in carefully measured quantities. 
                            Due to this it would use less food and lead to better fed animals.
