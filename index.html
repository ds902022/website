                            Recently I got into farming during some of my free time and really started to enjoy it.  You get to care for plants and wildlife while growing fabulous food produce all for 
                            just a few hours a day spent outside in the fresh air.  As enjoyable as it is however some of the manual labour required can be very tiring especially after a busy day working and 
                            so I have been looking into ways to reduce the manual workload, while still getting the same enjoyment and quality of food produce for my time spent farming.  Due to this I have 
                            started to use robotics to help with my farming and will be looking to further my use of robotics sometime in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On this site I will explain to you the different types of robots that I am currently using on my farm as well as what robots I am looking into for future usage.  I will also try to 
                            explain some of the positives and negatives of the different types of robots that can be used for farming and why I think that using robots for farming is the way of the future. 
                            I have many years of experience dealing with robotics at work which has helped with getting a deeper understanding of how these robots can be used most effectively and efficiently 
                            to save money, time and increase the yield.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have split the website into the current robots I'm using along with the positives and negatives for them, the future robots that I was planning to use along with their positives
                            and negatives as well.  The final page contains my contact information and location for anyone that would like help with improving their farming either through talking to me or 
                            visiting to view my farm for yourself.  Also feel free to contact me if you have any ideas that I have not mentioned on this site as most ideas I have found are on here.

                        <p>Tasks as simple as aerating the soil or planting new crops can become quite arduous when doing them for many hours or after a busy day of work.
