                            Welcome to the page on current usage of robots, so far I have started using robots for relatively simple tasks including watering, ploughing, spreading feriliser and weed killing. 
                            The current robots I am using are: drones for watering and spreading weed killer as well as an automated plougher with fertiliser spreading.  All of these robots save time and manual 
                            labour but come with side effects including high set up costs and long charging times as well as breakdowns.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The drones I use are very good at quickly watering entire fields as they fly fast and with gps systems are very accurate.  They also give very good coverage of the ground consistently 
                            due to the automatic nature of their flight.  Unfortunately the drones can go wrong which can be quite costly and cause a loss of efficiency so it is a good idea to have a mechanic or 
                            equivalent to repair them quickly although this is quite costly especially when added on to the cost of setting them up in the first place.  There is also always the possibility of 
                            something going wrong with the gps or the software of the drones, esecially at the start there will likely be some setting up issues where there are errors with the software or hardware. 
                            Once you get past the original issues they become quite easy to manage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the ploughing and spreading I have a couple of robots that appear very similar to a smaller tractor.  These robots will travel around the fields and plough the land as well as then 
                            fertilising the ground ready for planting.  They are very fast and save many hours spent out in the fields allowing me to do other tasks which require a more hands on approach.  They 
                            also use the fertiliser at a more consistent amount for more even spreading and do a more thorough job of ploughing the field.  Whilst they have their benefits the current cost to run 
                            is a little expensive and wont be as cost effective until salaries raise further.  They are also much more prone to breakdowns than other robots like the drones which requires more 
                            maintenance to ensure peak uptime.  If using these robots I would definitely recommend having a local mechanic to fix issues quickly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall I feel these robots have made life on the farm a lot easier and the cost is similar to that of hiring people to do the same work that these robots can do.  
                        </p>

                            This is an example image of how I spread water and weedkiller to my crops. By using a drone like this I can water large areas quickly and avoid damaging any plants. This allows for a saving in time 
                            and achieves a more consistent level of watering across the crops.
